# SXSE Panel Picker

## About PanelPicker

The PanelPicker is a two-step online process that allows the SXSW community to have a significant voice in programming SXSWedu, SXSW Interactive, SXSW Film, SXSW Music and SXSW Eco conference activities (presentations, panels, discussions, demonstrations, etc.)

STEP 1 encourages the community to enter proposals for daytime conference programming for all four SXSW events.

STEP 2 allows the community to browse all of these ideas, leave comments, and vote for what they think are the best fit for the March event.

## Analysis of current user entries

* After scraping the data from [http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote]() I found **5,310** entries in the competition, though the search infrastructure provided by PanelPicker shows only **4,450** entries available, meaning that some of the data gathered is not available through the online search.

The resulting analysis was performed on all 5,310 entries:
