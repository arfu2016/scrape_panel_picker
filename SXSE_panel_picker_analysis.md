# SXSE Panel Picker

## About PanelPicker

The PanelPicker is a two-step online process that allows the SXSW community to have a significant voice in programming SXSWedu, SXSW Interactive, SXSW Film, SXSW Music and SXSW Eco conference activities (presentations, panels, discussions, demonstrations, etc.)

STEP 1 encourages the community to enter proposals for daytime conference programming for all four SXSW events.

STEP 2 allows the community to browse all of these ideas, leave comments, and vote for what they think are the best fit for the March event.
